# CalculatorXI
By Squ1dd13 (Alex)

This is a tweak to get the iOS 11 calculator on iOS 10 (and kind of 7-9 as well I think).
Slightly buggy, but works pretty well. The .deb is available at http://squ1dd13.tk/repo.
NOTE: Some of the classes that appear to have been hooked are actually just fake names. This is because they are Swift classes. Check the %ctor for the real class.
